==================================
             Credits
==================================

The entire Map's ACS scripting was (painfully) done by me. I have also made most decorate scripts and almost all of the map, some sprites, sounds, and textures.

Despite all of my work, this project would be nothing without the people who contributed their ideas, time, and resources that resulted in this final product.
Seriously, I thank every single person in this document from the bottom of my heart.

Massive thanks to people on Doomworld for contributing awesome minigame event ideas for my wad! You guys rock!!!
And the ZDoom Forums community for helping me sort out some bugs with ACS and Decorate.
MDF and Nuclear Empire have been instrumental in making playsessions happen, driving interest in the project and providing invaluable feedback.
Another special thanks to the following people/users for beta-testing, and for being there whenever I updated the beta server to post suggestions and have a fun time. I love you all! Hats for all of you! :*

I wish to credit the original authors of anything I used, since they deserve to know their content is being used. I emailed every one, but most emails bounced back, since I have content that is older than the pyramids. 
If you don't want your stuff in this WAD, please email me at buu342@hotmail.com and I will remove the content. No biggie. 
All content is used for entertainment purposes and is non-profit. Music clips are shorter than 15 seconds. This should keep those pesky lawyers away.
Since the resources are used so sparingly, I will list the minigames (in order of programming date (sorry, I'll get to organizing it alphabetically someday)) and the resources used will be listed, as well as authors of said original content. 
Anything else not mentioned can be assumed that I made it. And yes, feel free to use it yourself. Credit would be nice but not required.

Hope you enjoy DoomWare!

P.S. Wow, you actually read the credits??? Proud of you <33
